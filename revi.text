Here is an example of how to create a simple loader using HTML and CSS:

HTML:

Copy code
<div class="loader">
  <div class="loading"></div>
</div>
CSS:

Copy code
.loader {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}

.loading {
  border: 3px solid var(--primary);
  border-top: 3px solid transparent;
  border-radius: 50%;
  width: 50px;
  height: 50px;
  animation: spin 1s linear infinite;
}

@keyframes spin {
  0% {
    transform: rotate(0deg);
  }
  100% {
    transform: rotate(360deg);
  }
}
This creates a "loader" element that takes up the entire screen and centers its contents. The "loading" element is a circular element with a transparent top, a primary color border and a loading animation that rotates the element.

The animation is defined using the @keyframes rule and the animation property, the animation name is "spin" and it has a duration of 1s, runs linear and infinite.

You can also customize this by changing the size, color and animation as per your requirement.

You can also style the loader with your own colors by replacing var(--primary) with your desired color value and customize the animation properties as well.
This is a CSS custom property (also known as a CSS variable) that is used to store a specific value that can be reused throughout the stylesheet.

The "--primary" value is the name of the custom property, and "#e65f58" is the value that is being assigned to it. The value "#e65f58" is a hex color code that represents a specific color.

This custom property can be used in various CSS declarations by referencing it using the var() function. This allows for consistent and efficient styling throughout the stylesheet, as the value only needs to be changed in one place if desired.

For example, you can use --primary as a color value in other css properties like background-color, color, border-color etc.

.example-class {
background-color: var(--primary);
}

This will change the background color of an element with class "example-class" to the color defined in --primary.
 
 -moz-transition: all 0.3s cubic-bezier(0.165, 0.84, 0.44, 1);
  -o-transition: all 0.3s cubic-bezier(0.165, 0.84, 0.44, 1);
  transition: all 0.3s cubic-bezier(0.165, 0.84, 0.44, 1);
  
 This CSS code sets a transition effect for all properties of an element, with a duration of 0.3 seconds and a cubic Bezier timing function. The specific Bezier curve is defined by the four values (0.165, 0.84, 0.44, 1) which controls the acceleration/deceleration of the transition. The -moz- and -o- prefixes are used for compatibility with older versions of Mozilla and Opera browsers.
 -webkit-transform: translate(0, -8px);
This specific line of code applies a "transform" effect to the element, specifically a "translate" effect, using the -webkit prefix. The translate effect moves the element horizontally by 0 pixels and vertically by -8 pixels. This is used to adjust the position of the element on the webpage. This is specific to webkit based browsers such as Safari and Chrome.
 -ms-transform: translate(0, -8px);

This specific line of code applies a "transform" effect to the element, specifically a "translate" effect, using the -ms prefix. The translate effect moves the element horizontally by 0 pixels and vertically by -8 pixels. This is used to adjust the position of the element on the webpage. This is specific to Internet Explorer browser.
 transition: all 0.3s cubic-bezier(0.165, 0.84, 0.44, 1);
This line of code applies a "transition" effect to the element. The "transition" property is used to smoothly change CSS property values over a specified duration.

The "all" value indicates that the transition effect will be applied to all CSS properties. The "0.3s" value indicates that the duration of the transition effect will be 0.3 seconds.

"cubic-bezier(0.165, 0.84, 0.44, 1)" is a timing function that defines the speed curve of the transition. It allows you to adjust the acceleration and deceleration of the transition, giving you more control over the animation. It takes four values, which are the x and y coordinates of two control points that define the curve. These values are used to create a smooth and natural animation.
 -webkit-animation: rotate 1s infinite linear;
This line of code applies an "animation" effect to the element, using the -webkit prefix. The "animation" property is used to animate the element over time.

The "rotate" value is the name of the animation that is being applied, which in this case, would be a rotation animation.

The "1s" value indicates that the duration of the animation will be 1 second.

"infinite" means the animation will keep repeating over and over again.

"linear" value indicates the timing-function of the animation. A linear timing function causes the animation to change at a constant speed.

 @-webkit-keyframes rotate {
  100% {
    -webkit-transform: rotate(360deg);
  }
}

This is a CSS animation keyframe rule that is used to define the animation's behavior at specific points during the animation. The "@-webkit-keyframes" rule is used to define the keyframes for the animation, and the "rotate" value is the name of the animation.

In this example, the keyframe rule is setting the final state of the animation to rotate the element 360 degrees. The "100%" value indicates that this keyframe rule is defining the state of the animation at the end of the animation.

The "-webkit-transform: rotate(360deg);" property is used to rotate the element 360 degrees. This is specific to webkit based browsers such as Safari and Chrome. */
